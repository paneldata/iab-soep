## Study info

The IAB-SOEP Migration Sample is a joint project of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) and the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). The project attempts to overcome limitations of previous datasets by drawing a sample that takes into account changes in the structure of migration to Germany since 1995. The dataset is a supplementary sample to the SOEP-Core study and is therefore completely harmonized with the SOEP and integrated into SOEP v33.1 (identical questionnaire with additional questions on the respondent's migration situation). The study opens up new perspectives for migration research and gives insights into the living situations of new immigrants to Germany.
In 2016 the CAMCES- Tool was used in the IAB-SOEP Migration Sample to generate another ISCED variable to measure the highest level of educational attainment, not based on information of the individual questionnaire but driven by a database.

## Method

The complete set of questionnaires and addtional documents for the fieldwork are available as SOEP Survey Papers:

The questionnaire for respondents who have already participated in at least one wave of the SOEP Migration Sample is nearly identical to the individual questionnaire used in the SOEP-Core study. The integrated individual and biographical questionnaire for first-time respondents covers their complete migration, education, and labor market histories in both their country of origin and in all other countries in which they have lived. Additionally, the questionnaire includes several new batteries of questions that had not been included in the SOEP or other household surveys in Germany previously, or not in the necessary depth. Examples include questions on earnings and labor market integration and occupational status before migration, migration decisions in the family and partnership context, and purposes and transfer channels of remittances.  The household questionnaire is also nearly identical, except of a few questions, to the household questionnaire used in the SOEP- Core study. Other questionnaires, e.g. the youth questionnaires or the mother- child questionnaires are identical to the questionnaires used in the SOEP-Core study.

The IAB-SOEP Migration Sample substantially increases the sample size of the SOEP-Core study for research on migration and on the lives of immigrants in Germany. A total of 4,964 individuals residing in 2,723 households participated in the first wave of the survey in 2013. With the 2015 Migration Study, M2, IAB and SOEP are focusing on recent immigrants who arrived in Germany between 2009 and 2013. In the first wave of this additional sample, 1,096 households with 1,711 household members participated. 

In 2016, the overall IAB-SOEP Migration Study consisted of 2,155 households with 3,832 household members. Since the survey is also included in the “regular” SOEP survey, SOEP-Core, migrants from other SOEP-Core samples can be included in analyses, further increasing the number of observations.


## Data access


Access at the SOEP Research Data Center: All SOEP users with a valid contract can order the data from the IAB-SOEP Migration Sample through the SOEPhotline or from our SOEP website without needing to sign any additional data distribution contracts. The dataset is available at no charge upon request and can be downloaded from a secure server with an individual password. For more information on the SOEP application process, see: Access to the SOEP data.

Access at the IAB Research Data Centre: The normal application process at the IAB RDC should be followed.

The survey data will be distributed to all SOEP users automatically as of SOEP Version 33.1, to be released in January 2018. The data from the IAB-SOEP Migration Sample along with the linked information from the register-based IAB dataset are available at IAB Research Data Centre. The data are weakly anonymized and available for analysis on site at the IAB in Nuremberg in the framework of a guest visit or at other external locations.


## Data description

The data structure is closely related to the structure used in the SOEP-Core study. Each wave (survey year) is identified by letters of the alphabet: the first wave in 1984 is wave "A", 1985 is wave "B", 2009 is wave "Z", followed by wave "BA" in 2010 and so on. Therefore the survey year 2016 is identified by the wave prefix "BG". For each year of SOEP data, there are separate data files for households (e.g., BGH) as well as for individual respondents (e.g., BGP and BGP_MIG) and children (e.g., BGKIND) based on interview information. These observations make up the net population, with each of these files containing as many records as interviews could be conducted. Additional data files with a limited number of variables based on the address log constitute the gross number of households and persons, i.e., all households and household members that were eligible for an interview in any given year.

Persons who received the individual questionnaire are completely integrated into the dataset BGP. New respondents, who complete the integrated Individual and Biographical Questionnaire, are also integrated in BGP when possible, and the respective biographical information can be found in the BIOL dataset. The dataset BGP_MIG contains all information from the integrated Individual and Biographical Questionnaire. The information from the household questionnaire is fully integrated into the dataset BGH, and the data from the Youth Questionnaire and the various questionnaires given to parents about their children are integrated into the respective datasets. 

The dataset CAMCES contains another ISCED generated with the CAMCES- Tool.

### Missing conventions

Survey variables might be missing, i.e., without a valid code or value for different reasons. In the SOEP, negative values are not valid for any variable, but are used instead to code different reasons for missing information. There are two distinctions for missing values: they may originate in the respondent's answer or in the survey design.
|Code | Meaning|
|:----:|-----|
|-1|no answer /don`t know|
|-2|does not apply|
|-3|implausible value|
|-4|inadmissible multiple response|
|-5|not included in this version of the questionnaire|
|-6|version of questionnaire with modified filtering|

With the extension of the SOEP in recent years, entirely new samples like the IAB-SOEP-Migration Sample have been added to the core. In these samples questions are sometimes left out completely, for instance to shorten the questionnaire or because the focus of the sample is different. In such a case, the variable will be set to "-5 Not included in this version of the questionnaire" for an entire subsample.

With the use of CAPI, recent developments include an integrated individual and biographical questionnaire, i.e., the biographical part and the regular part of the questionnaire are combined into one questionnaire. Some of the questions in the biographical part are repeated in the regular part. While in the PAPI mode, the respondent will answer the same question twice, the CAPI makes it possible to filter the respondent around the question if it has already been asked. These cases are very rare: if they occur, they receive a code "-6 Version of questionnaire with modified filtering".
